## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Tailwind Docs

### What I learned
While creating the project, i learned the mobile-first workflow, read the tailwind css docs and got better at writing designs. I also learned about thinking in React approach.



### Continued development
While doing the challenge, i had a hard time using media queries, i was a bit confused about how to restrict the media queries styles from affecting my desktop desgin while maintaining the mobile design. I am still not satisfied with the way i have written,
So I will be focusing on responsive development more in future projects.
